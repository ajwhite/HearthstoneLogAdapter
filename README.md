# Hearthstone Log Adapter
This is a library that allows you to access live events from your Hearthstone client as a game is played. It behaves as an adapter on the log file and broadcasts events, such as when an opponent card is played, or the playing user draws a card.

### Installation
```
npm install hearthstone-log-adapter
```
